A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE QUIZ APP IMPLEMENTAION PROCESS

Introduction:
This application is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create an interactive quiz experience. I will be explaining the certain features and design choices that led to the implementation of the application.


Features:
a. Feedback System:
   - The feedback system provides immediate indications when the user selects a correct option. This helps users track their progress and boosts their confidence.
   - By using JavaScript, users can dynamically update the user interface to display visual cues, such as changing the color of the selected option or showing a feedback.


b. Timer Functionality:
   - The timer allows users to keep track of their time during the quiz. It adds an element of excitement and urgency to the experience.
   - Using JavaScript, I implemented a countdown timer that starts when the quiz begins and displays the remaining time to the user.
   - When the time is up, you can trigger an event to automatically submit the quiz or display a message notifying the user.


Technology Stack:
The Quiz Application is built using the following technologies:
- JavaScript: The backbone of the application, used for logic and interactivity.
- HTML: The structure of the quiz interface and content.
- CSS: The visual styling and animations that bring your quiz to life.
- Media Queries: Used to ensure responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.


Design and Responsiveness:
The use of CSS animations adds a touch of interactivity and engagement. I considered incorporating smooth transitions between quiz questions and some eye-catching effects when displaying correct answers.


To ensure a seamless user experience, i've implemented responsiveness using media queries. This means your quiz application will adapt and look great on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones. Users can enjoy the quiz anytime, anywhere!


Instructions for Running the Application:
To run the Quiz Application, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the project files from your GitHub repository.
